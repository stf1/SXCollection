  Also I must thank to many many people, who are playing
the maps with me while I am testing them. Without those
people it would be much harder to determine the proper
settings in the maps, because everyone is playing in
different style and buys different upgrades and it helps
to find most problems that I couldn't find out playing
them myself.
